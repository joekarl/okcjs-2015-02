I moved things around to make things a bit easier to use in my demo.

----------------------------

This is the (or at least an) Awesome Possum, done for Ultimate Smash Friends, a very cool-looking super smash brothers clone.  It could also work for any sort of fighting game, or maybe a platformer.  Note that he comes both in normal vanilla and powered-up mango flavors.
